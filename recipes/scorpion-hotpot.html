    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>(serves 3-4)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Huge Scorpion (1)</li>
        <li>Walking Mushroom (1)</li>
        <li>Mushroom feet (2)</li>
        <li>Seaweed (artic moss, star jelly) (as needed)</li>
        <li>Invertatoes (about 5 med. size)</li>
        <li>Dried Slime (to preferance)</li>
        <li>Water (as needed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>First of all, wash the slime in hot water and a little citrus juice, either wipe the moisture off or knead salt into it, then dry it fully in the sun, <em>the ideal is to starve it for two weeks, it also takes time to dry so maybe you can't wait all that.</em></li>
        <li>When the slime is ready cut them into noodles.</li>
        <li>Take of the pincers, head, legs and tail of the scorpion, <em>you can technically eat the tail, but it will give you diarrhea</em>.</li>
        <li>Cut scores along the body of the scorpion, <em>this way the heat travels better, broth gets out, and the whole dish is tastier</em>.</li>
        <li>Take out the innards of the scorpion, <em>they are bitter and their texture isn't good. If you stew and ferment them ther are good beer snacks but that's a bit much for begginers.</em></li>
        <li>Cut away the rump (root end) and 3 centimeters of the surface of the walking mushroom,<em>the legs are tasty so you should use all fo them</em>.</li>
        <li>Cut the invertatoes in pieces.</li>
        <li>Add everything to the pot with water and cook it until the scorpion flesh turns red</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
