            <li>Stir until it thickens up.</li>
            <li>Once it's smooth, add the rest of the scorpion soup and some roughly chopped fruit.</li>
            <li>Mix it a bit, and pour it in the frying pan.</li>
            <li>Let it heat up until the surface begins tu bubble.</li>
            <li>Garnish it with the last of the fruit.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
